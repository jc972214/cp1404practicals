# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Typically, I underestimated how long a program would take me. I tended to get sidetracked while completing an exercise
by experimenting with the different functionalities of functions and most pracs took longer than I anticipated.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

After under-guessing multiple times, I think I began to realise that most programs would take me longer than I thought as
they usually had a level of complexity I hadn't thought about when starting.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That I need to always ensure I have ample time to complete tasks and that I cannot leave something until the last minute
as it might take much longer than I originally thought. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I mostly learnt how to write good docstrings as they were frequently pointed out by reviewers each week. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learnt how to better review my own code before making a pull request. By analysing my code like I would someone else,
I was able to identify things that I might point out when complete someone else's code review and amend them.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I tended to get lost with using branches on PyCharm and somehow lost all my files for pracs 5-7 when merging. I probably
misunderstood the instructions, but I did feel like a video explaining this process could have been easier to follow rather 
than following through, especially since most of Lindsay's screenshots or explainations were done on a Mac, and there were
some differences with Windows devices. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Not sure, most of my programs worked and I feel like I took feedback in really well and applied it to the next prac.
