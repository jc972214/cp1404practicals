# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

70% (still have to watch some from week 1, have watched all of week 2).

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Monday from 2pm

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Attending all the in-person classes. However, I did miss the second practical class as I was unwell. Additionally, I feel like I am actively trying to break previous coding habits developed in other classes to try wrote clean and efficient code, rather than code which just "works".

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I haven't taken any notes yet. If I start to write rules I learn within class I can create my own "programming patterns" repository in my own notes.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Writing efficient code the first time. Initially, all my code is just working but needs to be thoroughly refined.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Writing my own code without looking at the solutions. Additionally, once I have finished writing and committing my own code, I am viewing the solutions to see how I could have refined my code and taking note for next time.
