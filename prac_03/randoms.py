"""Random Numbers"""

# Q1.

# I saw 16
# The smallest number I could have seen is 5
# The largest number I could have seen is 20

# Q2.

# I saw 5
# The smallest number I could have seen is 3
# The largest number I could have seen is 9
# Line 2 could not have produced a 4 as it only allows numbers from 3 to 10 in increments for 2. Meaning the only possible options are 3, 5, 7, or 9.

# Q3.

# I saw 4.084234088291388
# The lowest number I could have seen is 2.5
# The highest number I could have seen is 5.5
