# CP1404 
# Practical 07

My name is Thomas Dallimore, and I am a university student at James Cook University.
I am currently studying Electrical Engineering and Data Science. 
This repository stores programs required to complete Practical 7 for CP1404.

Lesson's learned about writing "clean code":
- Writing code quickly isn't the same as writing code efficiently
- Proper variable naming is important so that the type of variable, and it's purpose can be easily distinguished.
- Effectively using doc-strings and comments helps decypher the use of code. It also makes it obvious when a function can be used if the same comment is mentioned more than once.
